Bits n' Bites is our personal blog the two of us created together so we could share our thoughts with the world. If you like code, privacy or food, you've come to the right place!

## Status

The project is currently under active development, and is not yet available for general use.

## Privacy

Privacy is something that's pretty important to us, and we feel that should be reflected in our blog as well. That's why the platform is open source, so you can plainly see what information we collect and what services we use. This section will be updated as we continue to work on the platform and add features, but please know we take your privacy seriously.

### Netlify

We use netlify for building & hosting the web application

### Third party services

We are proud to say that currently, we are not using any third party services that might be sucking up your data (to the extent of our knowledge). We are building a custom backend from the ground up in Rust so we can give you a great experience without sacrificing your privacy.

## Security

TODO

## Footnote

We hope you found what you came for, and that you enjoy the content we will be writing about in the future!
